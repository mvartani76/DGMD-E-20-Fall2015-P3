      <p>So here is the basic story... The abbreviated version of course...:)</p>
      <p>I have loaned out way too much money to my friends and it has become very difficult for
      me to keep track of who owes me what...</p>
      <p>Of course I should not have been loaning out this money as it was causing me a
      lot of grief and I was not getting paid back 100% but I feel bad for the people asking to borrow money
      and am a gigantic sucker...</p>

        <p>Any sob story you tell me can extract any amount of money from me...</p>
        <p><em>"I am trying to pay my way through my web development class and cannot afford to pay rent now..."</em></p>
        <p><em>"I cannot pay you rent because I forgot about my
        insurance payment..."</em></p>
        <p><em>"I will get you your money next week..."</em></p>
        <p><em>"I thought you didn't need the money until next week?"</em></p>
        <p><em>"Wait a second... I thought I only owed you two thousand bucks?"</em></p>
      </span>
      <p>I have tried to work on this but have not been able
      to correct this non-productive behavior of mine...</p>

      <p>With all of today's technology I figured there should be an easy way for me to keep better track of the money that is owed
        to me as well as facilitate methods for more convenient payment methods (both for me and the person that owes me money!!)</p>

      <h1>How did I do this before?</h1>
      <img src="./images/paper-on-desk.jpg" alt="Paper on Desk" class="paperondeskpic">
      <p>Lending out money and attempting to collect in the past has been a very difficult and frustrating process to say the least.</p>
      <p>I have used Excel, Quicken, Word, Email, and paper slips to track how much money I have loaned out to who and when... I would
        xerox checks that were sent to me and provide paper receipts for those who paid with cash...</p>
        <p>Needless to say that this system became very cumbersome and any lapse on my part (ie forgetting to document a loan or payment), dramatically increased the complexity
        of my system...</p>
        <p class="clear">&nbsp;</p>
      <h1>The Solution(s)...</h1>
      <p>With cheap cloud computing and storage, ubuiquity of smart mobile devices with strong application ecosystems, and the 
        skills that I have gathered in my web development classes, I have put together a full payment solution that 
        significantly reduces the stress and issues associated with loans and payment collection.</p>
      <p> It turns out that this solution can be used by others as well and with the increased use of normalized APIs,
          I can connect my solution with other systems and infrastructure such as payment, workforce, and asset tracking 
          solutions, both new and legacy.</p>
          <h1>Is this for you?</h1>
          <p>Well if you owe me money, you have to use this...:) If you want to borrow money from me, you have to use this...:)
